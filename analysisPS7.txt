Function for time complexity is F(n) = (n*m + nlog(n) + n*m) where m is the filtered interepreters and n is total no of nodes

Worst Complexity = O(n^2) if m = n



Hence, Worst Complexity = 484

--------Function displayCandidates --------

Function for time complexity is F(n) = (n + n)

Worst Complexity = O(n)



Hence, Worst complexity = 22

--------Function displayCandidates --------

Function for time complexity is F(n) = (n + n)

Worst Complexity = O(n)



Hence, Worst complexity = 22

--------Function findDirectTranslator --------

Worst Complexity = O(n^2)



Hence, Worst Complexity = 484

--------Function findDirectTranslator --------

Function for time complexity is F(n) = (n^2)

Worst Complexity = O(n^2)



Hence, Worst Complexity = 484

--------Function findTransRelation --------

Function for time complexity is F(t) = f(n) + f(e) where f is a function of traversing each nodes and a function for traversing through each edge

Worst Complexity = O(N + E)

Hence, Worst Complexity = 13

--------Function findTransRelation --------

Function for time complexity is F(t) = f(n) + f(e) where f is a function of traversing each nodes and a function for traversing through each edge

Worst Complexity = O(N + E)

Hence, Worst Complexity = 9
